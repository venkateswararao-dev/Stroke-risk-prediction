ML-Based Stroke Risk Prediction
📝 Project Overview
The ML-Based Stroke Risk Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the risk of stroke in patients based on various medical and demographic attributes. The early detection of stroke risk can significantly aid healthcare providers in implementing timely preventive measures, potentially saving lives and improving healthcare outcomes.

🎯 Objectives
Predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on patient health parameters.

Enable early diagnosis and assist medical practitioners in making informed decisions.

Leverage machine learning techniques for accurate, data-driven risk assessment.

🗂️ Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Description: The dataset includes various medical and demographic features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease history, average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status that can influence the likelihood of a stroke.
